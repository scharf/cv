<h1>Michael Scharf</h1>

<p><img src="MichaelScharf.jpg" alt="Michael Scharf"></p>

<p>Born 25-Apr-1961 in Heidelberg, Germany, married since '82, one daughter (born '86).</p>

<h2>The beginning of my career -- why Physics?</h2>

<p>I have a <strong>diploma in physics form the University of Heidelberg</strong> and
    a passion for computing since I am 15. The reason I studied physics
    (starting '81) and not computer science was that I had such a strong
    interest in computing that I thought I would learn it anyway. Physics
    was interesting because of its focus on fundamental principles and I
    hoped I would learn scientific thinking. <strong>I have always been
        fascinated by the fact that our existence is based on a few "simple"
        and elegant laws</strong>. The urge to reduce complex system to a set of
    simple and composable parts has always been a driving force in my
    life.</p>

<h2>1986-1995 Computational Biology</h2>

<p>From 1986-1995 I worked in the field of computational molecular
    biology at EMBL (European Lab for Molecular Biology). The first 3.5
    years I worked on my diploma thesis on protein structure prediction
    form protein sequences. Then worked as scientific assistant.</p>

<h3>Years of exploration</h3>

<p>During my time at EMBL I had a lot of freedom to experiment and
    explore new ideas and technologies. The team was interdisciplinary
    (biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists
    etc) and it was very exciting to have open discussions with people
    with a wide range of experiences, views and insights. <strong>I learned how
        important collaboration and communication is, but also how important
        exploration and trial and error is.</strong> I contributed lots of ideas,
    <strong>my boss often said "Michael creates many crazy ideas but one out of
        three is actually good".</strong></p>

<h3>ET++ and Erich Gamma</h3>

<p>Around 1987-1988 I discovered on the internet a <strong>C++ UI library
    called ET++<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1A25D3F9BFB6E7EAC01C26E0ED656955?doi=10.1.1.33.4786"
                  title="Design and Implementation of ET++, a Seamless Object-Oriented Application Framework">1</a></strong>, which
    was written By Erich Gamma<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/erich-gamma-a-pattern-of-success/134"
                                 title="Erich Gamma: A pattern of success">2</a> and Andre
    Weinand (if you have read Erichs design pattern book<a
            href="http://books.google.de/books/about/Design_Patterns.html?id=iyIvGGp2550C&amp;redir_esc=y"
            title="Ralph Johnson, Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Richard Helm: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software">3</a>,
    you'll find
    ET++ examples for most of the patterns). I used ET++ as the basis for
    a lot of tools I wrote for visualization and analysis of molecular
    biological data. Since I had access to Erichs PhD thesis and early
    drafts of the book, <strong>I became an evangelist of design patterns and
        that way of thinking.</strong> I would sill say Erichs work has a fundamental
    impact on the way I look at software and the way I design systems.</p>

<h3>Projects in work in a science context</h3>

<p>Here are some of the projects I have been working on and and that I
    remember. Maybe what I remember and what I find important in
    retrospect is telling something about me....</p>

<ul>
    <li>3d protein visualization in ET++ with lots of (at that time)
        new interactive capabilities
    </li>
    <li>query engine for a flat file protein database in gawk</li>
    <li>protein structure analysis tool in modula-2 (my diploma
        thesis)
    </li>
    <li>a very efficient object oriented implementation of a
        subset of Iris GL (which is the basis of OpenGL) in
        C for X-windows
    </li>
    <li>2d plotting (scatter plot) framework with direct links
        to data tables to show multidimensional data based on
        ET++ (was revolutionary in the 80ies)
    </li>
    <li>framework for generic remote proxies in python used to
        get local access to a database and analysis framework
        running on dedicated hardware
    </li>
    <li>fast algorithm to compare lots of (protein) sequences</li>
    <li>improved fastest existing algorithm for protein surface
        calculation by a factor of 10
    </li>
    <li>a plotting "program" in postscript that scientists
        could appended to their data files and that printed
        nice graphs and plots
    </li>
    <li>automation of protein analysis - we reduced the manual
        effort of a man month work to a few hours calculations
        with 95% similar results (was later commercialised) in
        <strong>perl and C++</strong></li>
    <li>using neural networks to improve protein sequence
        alignment
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>1994-2000 Contractor for TakeFive</h2>

<p><strong>ET++ had a build-in IDE (Integrated Development Environment)</strong> and a
    introspection system (because one of its inspirations was
    Smalltalk). Walter Bischofberger extracted and expanded a stand-alone
    IDE called sniff. A small startup company in Salzburg (Austria) named
    TakeFive commercialised sniff under the name SNiFF+. I joined them as
    contractor (initially part-time) form my home office in Heidelberg. At
    that time I was one of the few ET++ experts and that made me a natural
    fit.</p>

<h3>Collaboration as contractor working form a home office</h3>

<p>Initially I did some classical contracting work (like enhancing the
    editor). <strong>I also did customer training on the product as well as on
        programming C++, python and on design patterns.</strong></p>

<p>Over time <strong>I slipped more into the role of the lead developer.</strong> That
    was quite interesting, because <strong>I was the only team member working
        remotely</strong>. I was visiting the office regularly for 3-4 days every 4-6
    weeks. When I was there we had a lot of discussions and design
    sessions. I had lots of one-on-one sessions when I was in the office,
    and I often knew better than the "locals" who worked on what and who
    should talk to whom. Quite often, when I visited the office next time,
    the white board was in the state I left it last time. <strong>I learned that
        working in one office is not sufficient to have good collaborations.</strong></p>

<p>When I was in my home-office I did implementation work on the SNiFF+
    project. But I also did exploration work, trying out new ideas and
    finding solutions or generalizations for problems that I have
    seen. Although lot of my code went directly into the product, I
    preferred to work outside the current product stream to do forward
    looking, next-generation-of-the-product work. <strong>Many of the ideas and
        experiments I made failed. But lots of good ideas emerged.</strong> In many
    cases nobody asked me to look into a specific problem, but I used my
    senses to find areas where I could make a difference, where I could
    create something that would add value for customers or something would
    enhance the internal development.</p>

<h3>Freedom of a consultant</h3>

<p>Being outside the day to day work of the team, I had a kind of Joker
    role that gave me some freedom to reflect what we were doing in terms
    of technology, but also in terms of management and the general direction
    of the company. <strong>As a consultant, I never had the power to make
        decisions or direct people, but I gave advice to decision makers and
        implanted ideas and had very good relationships to the developers
        in the team.</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few things I remember</p>

<ul>
    <li>declarative, context based framework for views, command and
        menus (a kind of e4 for ET++)
    </li>
    <li>DSL and generator for python bindings to ET++ that encoded all
        the ownership rules of the not-garage collected c++-code -- this
        enabled a lot of extensions to SNiFF+ (mostly done by services)
    </li>
    <li>data driven tree-table implementation -- reduced time writing
        of a new tools form months to days
    </li>
    <li>OQL expression for (JSON like) data and tree/table filtering</li>
    <li>OQL implementation in python (never used in a product)</li>
    <li>python debugger with gdb like interface</li>
    <li>a distributed CORBA based implementation of the IDE (failed)</li>
    <li>rule based dialog model to separate the logic form the UI and
        to express logic declaratively
    </li>
    <li>pattern based parser for quick definition of syntax highlighting
        for programming languages
    </li>
    <li>lots of product contributions and enhancements including designing
        workflows and creating product enhancements
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>2000-2009 Contractor at Wind River</h2>

<p>We (the TakeFive) team started creating an the <em>next generation SNiFF+
    IDE written in Java</em> based on the learnings form the last years. Around
    that time, TakeFive got acquired by Wind River and a cultural change
    started by merging teams form different companies into one team. Wind
    River had four or five different IDEs with very different design
    philosophies. It turned out to be very difficult, if not impossible,
    to merge "the best" of different cultures into a single system. The
    company finally decided to move eclipse (which I was favoring). The
    company finally decided to go with eclipse<a href="http://eclipse.org">4</a></p>

<p><strong>One key learning for me was that mixing different frameworks and
    styles can lead to more complex systems - it might be better to use
    one consistent way of doing things, a set of principles everybody
    agrees on.</strong> In that sense eclipse was a good choice because it has its
    way of doing things (e.g. everything is a plug-in).</p>

<h3>Member of the Wind River architect team</h3>

<p><strong>I became member of the Wind River cross-project architecture team.</strong> One
    of the goals was of the architect team was to <strong>cross-pollinate ideas
        between different teams and to facilitate the communication between
        teams.</strong> There was a tendency for teams to not see the impact of
    decisions for other teams. The IDE had to integrate with tools that
    were produced by teams that have not been concerned with
    introperability with the IDE ("real men use command line tools and
    vi/emacs"). We also designed protocols and APIs for interacting
    components.</p>

<h3>Some projects I worked on</h3>

<ul>
    <li>wrote a generic reflective editor based on EMF <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">Eclipse Modeling
        Framework</a> using annotations. This allowed to replace 150,000 lines
        hand written C++ code with 3,500 lines of EMF (emfatic).
    </li>
    <li>EMF based configuration modeling system which allowed to specify
        composable components (using the reflective editor with dynamic
        EMF models)
    </li>
    <li>designed a builder pattern for EMF models that allowed to simplify
        writing parsers for existing text based file formats
    </li>
    <li>designed APIs between the runtime and the IDE</li>
    <li>worked on the integration of existing command line tools into the IDE</li>
    <li>created "magic interfaces" a way to declare data structures as
        interfaces that can be bound to different storage formats, like
        IMemento, IConfigurationElement, IPreferenceStore, IDialogSettings ....
    </li>
    <li>designed a UI for p2 based product installation application</li>
    <li>column oriented composable table abstraction</li>
    <li>fixed bugs and enhanced the architecture of one of the java based
        IDE frameworks and became eager to reduce code on each check-in -
        after one year I removed 36,000 lines of code - following the
        principle less is more
    </li>
    <li>efficient (vt100) terminal emulator for eclipse</li>
    <li>participated in a lot of the wind river workbench (C/C++ IDE
        based on eclipse CDT) design and architecture decisions
    </li>
    <li>worked on interaction design (Alan Cooper) and how this would
        make our products better
    </li>
    <li>developed the "What do I have to know to do the next step?"
        methodology for better usability (I should write a blog post on
        this topic...)
    </li>
    <li>educated teams on the benefits of domain driven design (DDD) - a
        reflection on specific challenges when writing tools for software
        developers...
    </li>
    <li>coaching and training of developers (by closely working
        together) - especially in model driven design
    </li>
</ul>

<p>One of my colleges in the architect team used to say about me: <strong>"Give
    Michael a problem to solve and he will find and solve a more general
    problem."</strong> (not sure if this is good or bad, but it reflects some truth
    about me)</p>

<h2>2009-2013 Employed as Principal Technologist at Wind River</h2>

<p>Early 2009 I decided it is time to become an employee and <strong>I became a
    member of the CTO office</strong> reporting to the CTO (Tomas Evensen). I spend
    most of my time on one CTO office project where we created a runtime
    analysis system for embedded systems. Wind River had a set of
    independent analysis tools for different operating systems using
    different technologies for instrumentation and target communication
    (partly because they came for different acquisitions). Although it
    started as research project between me and another Principal
    Technologist (Felix Burton), the decision was made quite early to use
    this as a pilot project for agile development (and scrum in
    particular) with 8 people. This added a lot of non-technical
    challenges and I learned a lot about the good and bad parts of agile.</p>

<p>On the technical side, <strong>I was responsible for java part and the
    (eclipse based) visualization</strong> and (with Felix) for the overall
    architecture and design of the system. In that position I had no
    management responsibilities but I did a lot of coding and pair
    programming with some of the members of the team.</p>

<ul>
    <li>co-designed a concise set of rules and operations for
        collecting and aggregating runtime data
    </li>
    <li>implemented a data processing engine for aggregating
        data - the engine was designed in multiple stages in
        different processes and on different systems (partly
        on the target, partly on the host)
    </li>
    <li>invented a value data structure that was a transactional,
        copy on write, delayed notification, efficient update,
        memory efficient and thread save (called IValue)
    </li>
    <li>configurable multistage data processing engine
        (interpreter pattern)
    </li>
    <li>template based configurable UI with DSL (Domain Specific Language)
        in Xtext with data binding to IValue which was (partly) driven
        by the incoming (meta) data
    </li>
    <li>code generator for several data aggregators that created C-code
        and virtual machine code
    </li>
    <li>extensible parser framework for a set of textual DSLs -
        allowed to plug in sub parsers in other DSLs
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Since Spring 2013: The Adventures of Web Development for a Very Small Startup-Company</h2>

<p><strong>Early 2013 it was time to leave Wind River and to go back to the roots
    of working on a start-up project.</strong> I am implementing a web application with a
    back-end in python and elastic search (which is java). The front end
    uses google angularjs. This involved a lot of learning new
    technologies. Because I am currently the main developer on this
    project, I have to work on all aspects of the project, including UI
    design, server setup, build process, bug fixing etc. It is a very
    humbling experience to see all the little details necessary to create
    a product. I have a much better understanding of the struggle of web
    developers and <strong>I see lots of opportunities how better tooling,
        libraries and services to support web developers.</strong></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>One thing I have learned is that <strong>creating simple systems is much
    harder than creating complex systems.</strong> Once a simple design has emerged
    it is hard for outsiders to understand how much pain and effort it is
    to reduce the complexity because simple and elegant systems are
    "obvious" once they are there.</p>

<p><strong>Software development is an inherent complex and social process.</strong> The
    systems we create are a reflection of the organizations and the people
    involved. <strong>Excellent teams develop a set of common principles that are
        consistent and that reduces complexity.</strong> It does not matter too much
    what the principles are as long as they are consistent.</p>

<p>Because what we do as developers has an impact on humans, I have a
    strong interest in sociology, psychology and the way our sensing our
    perception, our thinking works.</p>

<p>My power unfolds when I am part of a team and I am in direct contact
    with the team members in an open communication. My interest is to
    understand a system as a whole and to understand and share the
    common vision of the team.</p>

<p>Ultimately what we do is for our customers and therefore understanding
    the needs and pains of the customers is key. But often great solutions
    do not come from customer requests but form individuals and teams with
    a vision and empathy for the customers.</p>
